The provided C++ code implements a basic console-based To-Do List application. This application allows users to add, view, search, and delete tasks. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its functionality:

- **Libraries and Global Variables**: The code starts by including necessary libraries for input-output operations and string handling. It uses a global integer variable `ID` to keep track of task IDs. A `todo` struct represents a task, containing an ID and a description.

- **addTodo Function**: This function clears the screen, displays a welcome message, and prompts the user to enter a new task. The task is then written to "todo.txt" with an incremented ID, and the current ID is saved to "id.txt". If the user wants to add another task, the function recursively calls itself; otherwise, it exits after confirming the task addition.

- **readData Function**: This function clears the screen, displays a welcome message, and reads tasks from "todo.txt", displaying each task's ID and description until the end of the file is reached. This allows users to view all added tasks.

- **searchData Function**: This function clears the screen, displays a welcome message, and prompts the user to enter a task ID to search for. It reads through "todo.txt" to find and display the task with the matching ID.

- **deleteData Function**: This function uses `searchData` to find a task and confirms if the user wants to delete it. If confirmed, it copies all tasks except the one to be deleted into a temporary file "temp.txt", then replaces "todo.txt" with "temp.txt", effectively deleting the selected task.

- **main Function**: The program initializes the console, reads the last used ID from "id.txt", and enters a loop where it prompts the user to choose an action: add a task, view tasks, search for a task, or delete a task. Based on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding function to perform the operation, allowing for continuous task management.
