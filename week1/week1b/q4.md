What the Program Does
Compression:

Takes an Input String: The program starts with a string of text that you provide.
Uses LZ77 Algorithm: This is a method for reducing the size of the text by finding patterns that repeat.
Creates Tokens: The program turns the string into a series of tokens. Each token includes:
Offset: How far back to look in the text to find a repeating pattern.
Length of the Match: How many characters in the repeating pattern.
Codeword: The next character after the pattern.
Decompression:

Takes Tokens: The program uses the tokens created during compression.
Rebuilds the Original String: It reconstructs the original text from these tokens.
Features and Adjustments
Adjustable Settings: You can change certain settings in the code to improve how the compression works:
Window Size: The total amount of text the program looks at when searching for patterns.
Search Buffer Size: The part of the window where the program searches for repeating patterns.
Look-Ahead Buffer Size: The part of the window that the program is currently analyzing for patterns.
You can modify the variables window_size, search_buffer, and look_ahead_buffer in the code to adjust these settings.
Outputs
Compression Output: After compressing, the program shows the tokens in the format <offset, length of match, codeword>.
Decompression Output: The program can take these tokens and show the original text again.
User Interaction
Input: The program asks you to enter a string of text that you want to compress and then decompress.
By using these steps and features, the program helps to efficiently compress and decompress text using the LZ77 algorithm.
